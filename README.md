# Cells
## A cellular automaton designing engine
This engine is heavily inspired by [SandPond](https://github.com/TodePond/Sandpond)
by the amazing [Lu Wilson](https://github.com/TodePond/).

## So how does the engine work?
- The canvas on the left is where you can place various cells.
- The code panel on the right is where you define the rules for the cells.
- The gray box on the bottom-right is for logging error messages when updating the rules.
- The buttons in the upper-right are for various actions:

**Button**|**Function**
